## General information:
This package is designed to calculate the maximum possible theoretical yield of target reaction from a pathway composed of a list of KEGG reactions. The package offers the option to choose between two organisms: E. coli and yeast.

------------------------
## Organisms and Models
The package contains two sets of models, one for E. coli and another for yeast. E. coli models include a total of 58 models from the BiGG database, while the yeast models include 2 models.

------------------------
## Requirements
This package requires Python 3.8 or higher and the following Python libraries:

- path == 15.1.2
- requests == 2.27.1
- rdkit == 2022.9.5
- cobra == 0.25.0

-------------------------
## Usage
This package takes three inputs: a list of KEGG reactions, organism, and model.
    
    from dspyields import maximum_yield

    kegg_pathway = ['R01788', 'R02737', 'R02780', 'R02628', 'R00724']
    organism = "ecoli"
    model = "iJO1366.xml"

    maximum_yield(kegg_pathway, organism, model)

-------------------------
## Input
     1. `PATHWAY`: The pathway containing a list of reactions denoted by KEGG identifiers.
     2. `ORGANISM`: The organism to use. Valid options are ecoli for E. coli and yeast for S. cerevisiae.
     3. `MODEL`: The metabolic model for the selected organism. For E. coli, there are 58 models, while for S. cerevisiae, it contain 2 models.
Note: Each model is stored in a separate file using the SBML format and have the .xml extension.  

-------------------------
## Output
The package outputs the maximum theoretical yield of the target reaction for the given pathway.
